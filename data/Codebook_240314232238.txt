Label:      X1 Mathematics theta score

Description:
The math theta score represents the student's ability level on a continuous scale.   The theta score provides a norm-referenced measurement of achievement, that is, an estimate of achievement relative to the population (fall 2009 9th graders) as a whole. It provides information on status compared to peers (as distinguished from the IRT-estimated scale score which represents status with respect to achievement on a particular criterion set of test items).  When the score is not available, X1TXMTH1-5 are created as the multiple imputation values for X1TXMTH.  X1TXMTH is the mean of X1TXMTH1-5.  The  standard error of measurement for the theta score is X1TXMSEM. The standardized form of the mathematics theta score is X1TXMTSCOR. See Chapter 2 of the HSLS:09 Base-Year Data File Documentation (NCES 2011-328) for more information on the derivation of the math theta score.

Length:     7
Label:      X1 Mathematics standard error of measurement for raw theta score

Description:
The standard error of measurement (SEM) for the theta score indicates the precision in the ability estimate. It is calculated from the sum of item information functions for each item answered by each student. Unlike the classical standard error of measurement, which is a constant, the IRT standard error varies across the scale-score continuum. It is typically smaller for students whose theta score falls toward the center of the distribution because more students answered the items with average difficulty. However, students whose theta scores fall at the extremes of the distribution tend to have a higher SEM because their scores are based on items answered by fewer students overall.  When the score is not available, X1TXMSEM1-5 are created as the multiple imputation values for X1TXMSEM.  X1TXMSEM is he mean of X1TXMSEM1-5. See Chapter 2 of the HSLS:09 Base-Year Data File Documentation (NCES 2011-328) for more information on the derivation of the math theta SEM.

Label:      X1 Mathematics IRT-estimated number right score (of 72 base year items)

Description:
The math IRT-estimated scale score is a criterion-referenced measure of achievement. The criterion is the set of skills defined by the HSLS:09 framework and represented by the 72 items in the HSLS:09 math item pool. The estimated scale score for math is an estimate of the number of items students would have answered correctly had they responded to all 72 items in the item pool. The ability estimates and item parameters derived from the IRT calibration can be used to calculate each student's probability of a correct answer for each of the items in the pool. These probabilities are summed to produce the IRT-estimated number-correct scale score. See Chapter 2 of the HSLS:09 Base-Year Data File Documentation (NCES 2011-328) for more information on the derivation of the math scale score score.

Label:      X1 Mathematics standardized theta score

Description:
The math standardized T score provides a norm-referenced measurement of achievement, that is, an estimate of achievement relative to the population (fall 2009 9th graders) as a whole. It provides information on status compared to peers  (as distinguished from the IRT-estimated percent-correct score which represents status with respect to achievement on a particular criterion set of test items). The standardized T score is a transformation of the IRT theta (ability) estimate, rescaled to a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10. An advantage of the standardized score over the raw theta score is that it facilitates comparisons in standard deviation units. See Chapter 2 of the HSLS:09 Base-Year Data File Documentation (NCES 2011-328) for more information on the derivation of the math T score.

Label:      X1 Mathematics quintile score

Description:
The math quintile score is a norm-referenced measure of achievement. The quintile score divides the weighted (population estimate) achievement distributions into five equal groups, based on math score (X1TXMTSCOR). Quintile 1 corresponds to the lowest-achieving one-fifth of the population, quintile 5 the highest. To determine the quintile cut-points, the weighted distribution of the standardized scores was divided at the 20th, 40th, 60th, and 80th percentiles. Cut points were matched to unrounded standardized scores. See Chapter 2 of the HSLS:09 Base-Year Data File Documentation (NCES 2011-328) for more information on the derivation of the math quintile score.

Label:      X1 Mathematics proficiency probability score: level 1

Description:
The math proficiency probability scores are criterion-referenced and are based on clusters of items that mark five levels on the mathematics scale developed in HSLS:09. The levels are hierarchical in the sense that mastery of a higher level typically implies proficiency at the lower levels. The HSLS:09 proficiency probabilities were computed using IRT-estimated item parameters. Each proficiency probability represents the probability that a student would pass a given proficiency level. Clusters of four items were identified that marked mathematics level 1: algebraic expressions. Students able to answer questions like these have an understanding of algebraic basics including evaluating simple algebraic expressions and translating between verbal and symbolic representations of expressions. See Chapter 2 of the HSLS:09 Base-Year Data File Documentation (NCES 2011-328) for more information on the derivation of the math proficiency probability score.

Label:      X1 Mathematics proficiency probability score: level 5

Description:
The math proficiency probability scores are criterion-referenced and are based on clusters of items that mark five levels on the mathematics scale developed in HSLS:09. The levels are hierarchical in the sense that mastery of a higher level typically implies proficiency at the lower levels. The HSLS:09 proficiency probabilities were computed using IRT-estimated item parameters. Each proficiency probability represents the probability that a student would pass a given proficiency level. Clusters of four items were identified that marked mathematics level 5: linear functions. Students able to answer questions like these have an understanding of linear functions and can find and use slopes and intercepts of lines, and use functional notation. See Chapter 2 of the HSLS:09 Base-Year Data File Documentation (NCES 2011-328) for more information on the derivation of the math proficiency probability scores.

Description:
X1TMLINK characterizes the linkage between the student and the base-year math teacher associated with that student on the HSLS data file. The values assigned are a product of comparison between student-provided teacher information and the teacher information provided by the school. Values of 1 through 3 represent cases where the math teacher associated with the student is a respondent, with values of 1 representing the ‘strongest' links (due to consistency between student- and school-provided information), and values of 2, and 3 representing links considered less strong due to inconsistent and/or missing information. Values of 8 are assigned in cases where a link could not be established between the student and a teacher because the teacher did not respond to the questionnaire. Values of 9 are assigned in cases where the student's school indicates the student is not enrolled in a math class and the student either indicates they are not enrolled in a math class or their class information is missing. For more information about teacher linkages, please refer to chapter 5 of the HSLS:09 Base-Year Data File Documentation (NCES 2011-328).

Label:      X2 Mathematics theta score

Description:
The math theta score represents the student's ability level on a continuous scale.  The theta score provides a norm-referenced measurement of achievement, that is, an estimate of achievement relative to the population (fall 2009 9th graders) as a whole. It provides information on status compared to peers (as distinguished from the IRT-estimated scale score which represents status with respect to achievement on a particular criterion set of test items). When the score is not available, X2TXMTH1-5 are created as the multiple imputation values for X2TXMTH. X2TXMTH is the mean of X2TXMTH1-5. The standard error of measurement for the theta score is X2TXMSEM. The standardized form of the mathematics theta score is X2TXMTSCOR. See Chapter 2 of the HSLS:09 F1 Data File Documentation (NCES 2014-361) for more information on the derivation of the math theta score.

Label:      X2 Mathematics standard error of measurement for raw theta score

Description:
The standard error of measurement (SEM) for the theta score indicates the precision in the ability estimate. It is calculated from the sum of item information functions for each item answered by each student. Unlike the classical standard error of measurement, which is a constant, the IRT standard error varies across the scale-score continuum. It is typically smaller for students whose theta score falls toward the center of the distribution because more students answered the items with average difficulty. However, students whose theta scores fall at the extremes of the distribution tend to have a higher SEM because their scores are based on items answered by fewer students overall. When the score is not available, X2TXMSEM1-5 are created as the multiple imputation values for X2TXMSEM. X2TXMSEM is he mean of X2TXMSEM1-5. See Chapter 2 of the HSLS:09 F1 Data File Documentation (NCES 2014-361) for more information on the derivation of the math theta SEM.

Description:
The math IRT-estimated number correct is a criterion-referenced measure at the time of the First Follow-up assessment. The criterion is the set of skills defined by both the HSLS:09 Base Year and First Follow-up framework and represented by the 118 items used to score HSLS:09 First Follow-up math assessment. The estimated number correct for math is an estimate of the number of items students would have answered correctly had they responded to all 118 items in the item pool. The ability estimates (Thetas) from the First Follow-up and item parameters derived from the IRT calibration were used to calculate each student's probability of a correct answer for each of the items in the pool. These probabilities are summed to produce the IRT-estimated number-correct scale score. See Chapter 2 of the HSLS:09 F1 Data File Documentation (NCES 2014-361) for more information on the derivation of the math estimate number correct.

Description:
The math standardized T score provides a norm-referenced measurement of achievement, that is, an estimate of achievement relative to the population (fall 2009 9th graders) as a whole. It provides information on status compared to peers  (as distinguished from the IRT-estimated percent-correct score which represents status with respect to achievement on a particular criterion set of test items). The standardized T score is a transformation of the IRT theta (ability) estimate, rescaled to a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10. An advantage of the standardized score over the raw theta score is that it facilitates comparisons in standard deviation units. See Chapter 2 of the HSLS:09 F1 Data File Documentation (NCES 2014-361) for more information on the derivation of the math T score.

Description:
The math quintile score is a norm-referenced measure of achievement. The quintile score divides the weighted (population estimate) achievement distributions into five equal groups, based on math score (X2TXMTSCOR). Quintile 1 corresponds to the lowest-achieving one-fifth of the population, quintile 5 the highest. To determine the quintile cut-points, the weighted distribution of the standardized scores was divided at the 20th, 40th, 60th, and 80th percentiles. See Chapter 2 of the HSLS:09 F1 Data File Documentation (NCES 2014-361) for more information on the derivation of the math quintile score.

Description:
The math proficiency probability scores are criterion-referenced and are based on clusters of items that mark seven levels on the mathematics scale developed in the HSLS:09 first follow-up. The levels are hierarchical in the sense that mastery of a higher level typically implies proficiency at the lower levels. The HSLS:09 first follow-up proficiency probabilities were computed using IRT-estimated item parameters. Each proficiency probability represents the probability that a student would pass a given proficiency level. Clusters of four items were identified that marked mathematics level 1: algebraic expressions. Students able to answer questions such as these have an understanding of algebraic basics including evaluating simple algebraic expressions and translating between verbal and symbolic representations of expressions. See Chapter 2 of the HSLS:09 F1 Data File Documentation (NCES 2014-361) for more information on the derivation of the math proficiency probability score.

Label:      X2 Scale of student's interest in fall 2009 math course (REVISED)

Description:
This variable is a scale of the sample member's interest in their base-year math course; higher values represent greater interest in their base-year math course. Variable was created through principal components factor analysis (weighted by W2STUDENT) and standardized to a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. The inputs to this scale were S2MENJOYING, S2MWASTE, S2MBORING, S2FAVSUBJ, and S2MENJOYS. Only respondents who provided a full set of responses were assigned a scale value. The coefficient of reliability (alpha) for the scale is .65 or higher. For more information on this scale score, please see chapter 5 of the F1 Data File Documentation (NCES 2014-361).

Description:
The coursetaking completion flags (as well as the new basics variable X3TNEWBASIC) are based on credit counts without regard to the level of courses completed (except, where applicable, for the condition that at least two credits in a single foreign language must be earned). Only credits accrued in 9th through 12th grade (or ungraded) are included. For a cross-subject coursetaking composite that takes into account the level of courses completed, see academic track/concentrator (X3TACADTRCK). 
Values indicate course taking patterns.  Flag set when at least 4 standard credits earned in English, 3 standard credits earned in Social Studies, 3 standard credits earned in Science,  3 standard credits earned in Math,  .5 standard credits earned in computer science, and 2 standard credits earned in a Foreign Language.

Label:      X4 Major considering upon postsecondary entry is in a science, technology, engineering, or math (STEM) field

Description:
Indicates whether the major the student was most seriously considering when first entering postsecondary education after high school was in a science, technology, engineering, or math (STEM) field.
Based on the major the respondent was most seriously considering when first entering postsecondary education after high school as reported during the second follow up interview (S4FIELD). This may or may not be a declared major. Majors are classified using the U.S. Department of Education's Classification of Instructional Programs, 2010 edition (CIP 2010) and then classified as STEM using the definition used by the E.D. SMART grant. The variable S3FIELD_STEM contains similar data collected from either students or their parents in the 2013 Update. The 2013 Update collected intended field of study on the cusp of postsecondary entry or during the fall term of 2013 whereas this variable collects the intended major retrospectively. Question wording differs slightly due to temporal differences.  See also X4ENTMJSTNSF for NSF-supported STEM majors.

The definition of remedial was revised from ELS:2002 Postsecondary Education Transcripts Study. CCM Codes 23.1397 (Business English) and 27.9990 (Business Math) have been removed from the specific criteria based on recommendations by an expert panel. See T5CREMEDIAL for more information about remedial course designation. The 2010 College Course Map (CCM) is used to code these data. See https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/pets/ccm.asp for more information on the CCM.

Description:
Indicates the total amount of normalized college-level mathematics credits attempted during the student's postsecondary education as of June 2016.

Source: HSLS:09 Postsecondary Education Transcripts
Applies To: Postsecondary transcript respondents.

Notes: This variable utilizes "normalized" credits, which places the hours or credit units on a common scale so that credit units can be compared across institutions. See T5CNORMATT for further information about credit normalization. Duplicate course records, created by the transfer of course credits to one or more additional institutions, are only counted once. Courses that are a part of a graduate program, ended after June 2016, or are not provided by a transcript are excluded from this calculation. Courses with a normalized grade of advanced placement, transfer, audit, or drop are excluded from this calculation. The 2010 College Course Map (CCM) was used to code these data. See https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/pets/ccm.asp for more information on the CCM.
